      <h2>Battlefield 2042 Feels Like The Wrong Game At The Wrong Time</h2>
      <p>When I nail an MV-38 Condor transport hovering in the lens flare-filled sky with my rocket launcher,
        Battlefield 2042 is
        awesome. When my squad bursts onto the climate-torn scene in a massive tank, ramming through debris and blowing
        up
        abandoned office buildings, it’s a thrill to return to DICE’s militarized playground. When a round of All-Out
        Warfare
        starts up and 63 other internet strangers rush toward the first objective while explosions rain down overhead,
        it feels
        like what’s about to unfold next will be something surprising, bold, and special. Instead, it’s a trainwreck.

        The chaos that ensues has a somewhat predictable quality to it. Squads split up. Players try to run quickly to
        where the
        action is, only to be picked off by snipers or ripped to shreds by flankers. They then rush to respawn because
        they know
        nobody’s coming to revive them. Vehicles smash into walls or violently whip around as gunners try to aim without
        getting
        nauseous. Eventually a match ends and you win or lose, but this outcome will probably only feel tangentially
        related to
        whatever larger struggle transpired.</p>

      <h2>NVIDIA’s Full Stack Of Scaling Solutions For Gamers</h2>
      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fSx2VBHKz0/hqdefault.jpg" alt="NVIDIA DLSS">
      <p>NVIDIA DLSS adoption is growing rapidly, accelerated by easy-to-use Unreal Engine plugins and native support in
        Unity.
        This month 10 new games get DLSS, and a number of others, including Cyberpunk 2077, get upgraded to the new
        NVIDIA DLSS
        2.3 SDK for even better image quality. With an AI model that continuously improves through training on NVIDIA’s
        supercomputer, NVIDIA DLSS offers the best image quality and performance for over 130 games and applications.

        Alongside our DLSS updates, we’ve today released our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, which includes an update
        to the
        NVIDIA Image Scaling feature, improving our spatial upscaling and sharpening algorithm that supports all GeForce
        GPUs
        and games.

        The same sharpening and scaling algorithm in the Game Ready Driver is now also available as an open-source SDK,
        so
        developers have a full-stack solution, offering NVIDIA DLSS for the best image quality, and NVIDIA Image Scaling
        for
        cross-platform support.</p>
