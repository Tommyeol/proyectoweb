    <h2>Understanding the global chip shortage, a big crisis involving tiny components</h2>
    <p>“Right now we have a global supply chain in crisis,” says Patrick Penfield, a professor of supply chain practice
      at
      Syracuse University. “We’ve just never ever seen anything of this magnitude impact us before.”

      Nissan said it will be making 500,000 less vehicles due to the chip shortage. General Motors has had to interrupt
      some
      of its pickup truck production due to lack of semiconductor chips and has even been parking thousands of vehicles
      that
      are completed but still don’t have the needed chips. Apple CEO Tim Cook warned the public in July that chip
      shortages
      would affect sales of its phones and tablets.

      Intel chief Pat Gelsinger predicts it will be a year or two before supply can meet demand, and experts say holiday
      shopping may not offer the variety and options we’re used to.

      “Prices are definitely going to be higher for a lot of devices that require a semiconductor,” says David Yoffie, a
      Harvard Business School professor who spent almost three decades serving on the board of Intel. “Some products are
      literally not going to ship, or they’re going to be delayed.”

      The auto industry is getting hit hard, with estimates saying US manufacturers will make at least 1.5 to 5 million
      less
      cars this year. Ford and General Motors have already limited production. Tesla revised its own software to support
      alternative chips to maintain its production levels.

      And while consumer electronics companies like Apple and Samsung began stockpiling chips early on, saving them from
      the
      immense delays the auto industry is facing, Apple recently announced that the chip shortage is expected to delay
      iPhone
      production and is already impacting sales of iPads and Macs. Xboxes and Playstations are also in short supply.

      “It’s gonna be a tough holiday season,” says Penfield. “One thing I would caution consumers on is you probably
      won’t see
      the variety that you’re accustomed to. If you can buy before the holiday season really gets going, I think you’re
      going
      to be in good shape.”

      Here’s how the chip shortage happened—and when it might be over.</p>

        <h2>Battlefield 2042 Feels Like The Wrong Game At The Wrong Time</h2>
        <p>When I nail an MV-38 Condor transport hovering in the lens flare-filled sky with my rocket launcher,
          Battlefield 2042 is
          awesome. When my squad bursts onto the climate-torn scene in a massive tank, ramming through debris and
          blowing
          up
          abandoned office buildings, it’s a thrill to return to DICE’s militarized playground. When a round of All-Out
          Warfare
          starts up and 63 other internet strangers rush toward the first objective while explosions rain down overhead,
          it feels
          like what’s about to unfold next will be something surprising, bold, and special. Instead, it’s a trainwreck.

          The chaos that ensues has a somewhat predictable quality to it. Squads split up. Players try to run quickly to
          where the
          action is, only to be picked off by snipers or ripped to shreds by flankers. They then rush to respawn because
          they know
          nobody’s coming to revive them. Vehicles smash into walls or violently whip around as gunners try to aim
          without
          getting
          nauseous. Eventually a match ends and you win or lose, but this outcome will probably only feel tangentially
          related to
          whatever larger struggle transpired.</p>

        <h2>NVIDIA’s Full Stack Of Scaling Solutions For Gamers</h2>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1fSx2VBHKz0/hqdefault.jpg" alt="NVIDIA DLSS">
        <p>NVIDIA DLSS adoption is growing rapidly, accelerated by easy-to-use Unreal Engine plugins and native support
          in
          Unity.
          This month 10 new games get DLSS, and a number of others, including Cyberpunk 2077, get upgraded to the new
          NVIDIA DLSS
          2.3 SDK for even better image quality. With an AI model that continuously improves through training on
          NVIDIA’s
          supercomputer, NVIDIA DLSS offers the best image quality and performance for over 130 games and applications.

          Alongside our DLSS updates, we’ve today released our latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, which includes an
          update
          to the
          NVIDIA Image Scaling feature, improving our spatial upscaling and sharpening algorithm that supports all
          GeForce
          GPUs
          and games.

          The same sharpening and scaling algorithm in the Game Ready Driver is now also available as an open-source
          SDK,
          so
          developers have a full-stack solution, offering NVIDIA DLSS for the best image quality, and NVIDIA Image
          Scaling
          for
          cross-platform support.</p>
